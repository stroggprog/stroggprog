- 😄 Pronouns: ... that's your choice, not mine
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... As of Feb 2024, more than 57 million Raspberry Pi SoC boards have been sold (excluding RPI Pico sales)

I've been a professional programmer since the mid-1980s, working in Military, Airline, Banking, Retail, Corporate, Insurance (Health and Vehicle), Financial Trading and Game industries. Possibly other sectors I've forgotten.

I used to roast my own coffee, and got quite good at it until a Covid-19 infection put paid to that (not to mention the rising cost of energy).

Nowadays I code mainly the things I need to resolve issues I have - such as the Rust code to fetch structured information back from music-player-daemon so I can display a conky applet on my screen telling me what track is currently playing etc. but instead of using the standard conky mpd queries, it resolves data about the state of the queue. Or mars-clock-2 which is a new version of my original mars clock, but this time simpler, yet supercharged and immune from breaking external library security updates.

My 'alive-ho' daemon was written so I could determine which of my 20+ computers were actually running just by invoking a simple web page.

My rtap software was an early attempt to keep time on the  Moon (where time actually runs faster) in synch with Earth, by countering relativistic effects. My dad challenged me to write it after President Biden instructed NASA to develop timezones for the Planets and the Moon. There ya go, Dad :-)

Sometimes I code for the need, sometimes for the challenge, sometimes just out of interest, 'cos why not?
